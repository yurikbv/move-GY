          determining the availability of travel—related goods and services. The terms "we", "us", "our", "moveXYZ"

          <strong> Please read these Terms of Use carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability
            and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court.

          We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer,

        <h3 style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>DISPUTES; ARBITRATION</h3>
        <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>moveXYZ  is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try
          to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you or we may pursue claims as explained in this section.</p>
        <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>To give us an opportunity to resolve informally any disputes between you and us arising out of or
          relating in any way to the Website, these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, 
          any services or products provided, any dealings with our customer service agents, or any representations 
          made by us (“Claims”), you agree to communicate your Claim to <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>moveXYZinfo@gmail.com</span>. 
          You agree not to bring any suit or to initiate arbitration proceedings until 60 days after the date on 
          which you communicated your Claim to Customer Support have elapsed.  If we are not able to resolve your 
          Claim within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below. </p>
        <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>
          You and moveXYZ agree that
          <strong> any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in
          court, </strong>
          except that you and we may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. 
          This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, suppliers or any companies offering 
          products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement).
          This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of 
          whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration.
        </p>
        <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>
          <strong>
            There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
            However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
            (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs).  The arbitrator must follow and enforce these Terms of Use.
          </strong>
